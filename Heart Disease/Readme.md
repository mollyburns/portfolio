## Heart Disease Project
This dataset was imported with all numeric values, so a majority of the cleaning and standardizing that needed to be done was to translate the numeric values to their corrsponding descriptors. I used a variety of case statements to update the data as efficiently as possible and alter table/delete statements to remove the columns with numeric values.

There were also a number of duplicates found within the data, so I created a copy of the main table to delete the duplicates from in order to avoid deleting rows from the original file.
