## World Life Expectancy Project
This dataset presents lifespan details and mortality rates by country over a span of 15 years. After searching for duplicates and updating and obvious data errors, I evaluated the data to research what correlations I could find between lifespan by country and the other data provided.

Some of the main takeaways from this dataset were that most of the average GDPs are below the midline of 1500 when corresponding to a low average lifespan. The average lifespan for low GDP countries has a 21 year gap below the midline. I think this shows that countries with low GDP vary drastically in their healthcare systems and availbility of resouces. On the other side, where countries had GDP that was significatnly higher than the midline, the average lifespan vaires from the midline of 68 and goes up to 82 which is a 14 year difference. Overall average lifespan increased worldwide over the data collection period. 

The data included death rates for adults, children under 5 and infants. Only 28% of the countries reported zero infant deaths during the data collection period. 26% of the countries reported zero under-five deaths during the collection period, which shows that there are more infant deaths worldwide than deaths of children under 5; children have a higher chance of living once they make it past infancy.

I also looked at countries statuses and determined that there were no countries that changed from developing to developed during the data collection period. The data also allowed me to find that 24 countries had a lifespan over 80 years and to list those countries.

One last thing to mention is that I pulled BMI category data and was able to label average BMI values with their corresponding BMI descriptor (underweight, healthy, overweight, obesity, sever obesity) to deterind if lifespan had any correlation with BMI across the world. Assuming BMI ranges are the same in all countries, the data isn't what I would expect. This shows that severely obese BMI ratings are falling into the higher than average lifespan range. There is no direct and obvious correlation that I'm seeing, but underwight BMIs seem to fall into the lower end of the lifespan range and obese fall into the higher range of lifespan averages.
