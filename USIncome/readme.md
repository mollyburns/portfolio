## US Income Project
This project includes a review of data provided publicly by the government. After cleaning the data and correcting minor errors, I used the skills listed below to evalute average household incomes in a variety of ways. The dataset included mean and median income information by state, city and county. I used this information to look at which states had the lowest and highest mean and median incomes - I pulled the top and bottom 5, and the top and bottom 10. 

I also looked online to see what the federal poverty line is and how many cities and states have average incomes less than the federal poverty line. Based on the data provided there are 44 cities that reported a mean income that is below the poverty line. 

This dataset also included information on the amount of land and water in each city so I was able to do a small search based on that information and determine the citis and states with the most/least land and most/least water in the country.

An interesting takeaway was that the states that reported low mean incomes (the bottom 5) also reported median incomes that were close to the mean, but the states that reported the highest mean incomes (top 5) reported median incomes that weere significantly higher than the mean. This shows that the higher the mean income by state, there is a much larger range of incomes, with most households making higher than the mean incomes.
