### Capstone Project
This dataset presented employment data for Capstone company. The cleaning of this data was more simple and included removing duplicates and filling in data where the values were numeric instead of descriptive. 

I evaluated length of time with the company compared to hours worked by employee and by department. I found that employees who have worked at the comapny for 4-6 years work the most hours on average. This group of employees also had higher than average review ratings and the highest number of projects, which seemed to indicate that these people were working toward a promotion and shows why they would be working the most hours on average.

Looking by department, IT, R&D and technical and management work significantly more hours than other departments, so it would be wise to consider adding headcount to these departments. As far as projects go, there are a similar amount of projects for each deppartment, but projects take longer to complete in the businer departments, which could be another reason to consider adding headcount to these busier departments. 

Overall, employees who have been at the company for 3 years make up the largest percent of total among all salary categories. This could be a sign that after two years a lot of employees get a raises, however, the largest group is people who have worked for 3 years and are in the low salary category.

If the goal of the company is to reduce expenses and cut roles, recommendation would be to weed out employees who have worked at the company less than 4 years. The company has seen a lot of growth in the last 2-3 years, and the people who have worked at the company 4-6 years make up the largest group in the company. This group is working the most and is the most eligible for promotions and raises. Before the 2-3 year group gets more established, work on retaining the star employees and moving them into higher prodcution roles.
